## Issues

The screenshot feature is currently displaying everything except for the embedded twitter feeds. I'm not exactly sure why but I think it likely has something to do with either the of the packages that I used for the twitter feeds or the screenshots. The screenshot package I'm using called Vue2Img states in it's documentation that it uses the html2canvas and jsPDF packages, so I'm thinking that perhaps the iframes generated from the vuejs-twitter-feed library cannot be displayed on the canvas generated by html2canvas.
